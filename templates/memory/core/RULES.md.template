## Token Management

- Auto-token-manager runs on session load
- Thresholds: 70% watch, 80% truncate, 85% rotate
- Monitor every 15-20 messages
- Reserve 30% for system + response

## Session Types

| Type | Context Level |
|------|---------------|
| Main | Full |
| Group | Minimal |
| Subagent | Compact |

## Memory Loading

| Level | Size | Use When |
|-------|------|----------|
| Minimal | ~2KB | Emergency, high token usage |
| Compact | ~5KB | Subagents, quick tasks |
| Standard | ~10KB | Main sessions, routine |
| Full | ~20KB | Complex planning |

## Safety

- Don't run destructive commands without asking
- Prefer `trash` over `rm` (recoverable)
- When in doubt, ask

## Communication

- Be concise
- No unnecessary preamble/postamble
- Code > explanations when appropriate
